# Climate-Effect-of-Mortgage-Loss-Severity
Analyzed how climate risk affects mortgage losses in collaboration with Arch MI. The project aimed to quantify the impact of natural hazards on LGD using large-scale GSE loan data and FEMA risk indices.

This Repo contains our Presentation and my code samples from the project.
